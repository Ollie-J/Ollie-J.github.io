                <p class="about__text">Hi, I'm a graduate who studied Games Development at Norwich University of
                    the Arts. Throughout this course, I developed a deeper understanding of the c++ programming language, 
                    using Unreal Engine 4 & 5 to develop simple & complex games.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have taken part in Game Jams whilst at university which has helped me develop the skill of
                    being able to work in a team, as I had to communicate and work alongside other roles in the team
                    such as game design artists (Concept, Asset and Indie Developers).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of University, I still like to develop my own games, I'm currently working on a 3D
                    Top-Down Shooter point and click war game with destruction physics, Other than developing games,
                    I enjoy playing Chess, White-Water Kayaking and of course playing games, my favourite games
                    which I'm playing at the moment are; Escape From Tarkov and Age Of Empires 2.

                <p class="Description_NR">Neon Runner, is my endless runner prototype. Neon Runner uses procedural
                    level design which takes in 3 lanes that take in a random number of walls, that the player will
                    have to jump over. I chose to use the art theme neon as I was playing Cloudpunk at the time of
                    development and started to really like neon lighting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Within this prototype, the player has two goals, to see how far the player can get, aswell as
                    how many coins they can collect. For this I created a score system for the coins and a distance
                    system, these constantly update to show the real score at the time of gameplay.

                    10 Second Monkey is a game which I created with a team of 5 over 72 hours for a game jam event.
                    The theme for this game jam was "10 seconds". We used a mechanic to fit the theme by implementing a
                    rewind mechanic which
                    allowed the player to rewind there position in the game to up to 10 seconds in the past. There would
                    be collectables that
                    spawn around the game scene which the player could pick up, if the bar was full, then the player
                    would be able to execute
                    this mechanic fully.
                    <br>
                    The aim of this game to survive for as long as the player can, eliminating the scientists, aswell as
                    using the rewind
                    mechanic when the player gets swarmed by the scientists.

                <p class="Description_GP">
                    University group project, I worked with 6 other people who specialise in
                    different elements of developing a game, e.g. Asset Design, Concept Art and Indie Developer.
                    Through collaboration we decided on a fairy tale game, which incorporates multiple fairy tale
                    books which are located around the game scene. The player has to interact with all of the different
                    fairy tale characters through dialogue on different islands in order to reach the final island!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Along the way, the player is able to use portals as a way of getting a checkpoint, in order to
                    enable
                    this, the player has to walk through the portal which will take them back to the start of the game
                    scene.
                    However, if the payer falls to their death when traversing to different islands, they can use the
                    portal to
                    instantly reach an island that is near where they fell. This portal mechanic really helped not ruin
                    the gameplay
                    experience, as if the player fell without the portal, the player would have to restart at the
                    begining.

                    Physics based game, the aim of the game is to move the ball into the goal.
                    On the first level the player has to use enough force to knock the ball off of the cylinder post
                    by knocking the pole over, then pushing the ball into the goal, which takes them to the next
                    level.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The next level is alot more technical, this is because the player has to manoeuvre to 2
                    different small islands, before being able to push the ball. If the player doesn't use enough
                    force when pushing the ball, the ball will not reach the last island which the floor is the
                    goal, making the player restart the level.

                    The Asset is my final project I worked on at university. This stealth game themed game incorporates
                    Advanced AI implementation and a variety of differnet game mechanics eqipping the player with a
                    vision advantage. The aim for the player is to traverse through three room which are guarded by AI,
                    doing whatever is necessary to reach the exit door to escape.

                    I created a number guessing program "mini-game", that when run 
                    inside of a command window, will select a different number each time the program is run,
                    between 1-100. The aim of the game is to correctly guess the chosen number in the minimum 
                    amount of guesses. If the player inputs a number that is lower then the chosen number,
                    the program will output the text "Too Low", and if the input number is too high, the output text 
                    will show "Too High". This will happen until the player guesses the correct number. If the player 
                    guesses the correct number, the program will output a sentece congratulating the player on winning
                    the game aswell as telling the player the amount of guesses it took to beat the game.
